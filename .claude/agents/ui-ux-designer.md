   - Create mockups and interactive prototypes
   - Build comprehensive design systems and component libraries
   - Ensure responsive/adaptive design across devices

3. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA compliance throughout design process
   - Conduct accessibility audits
   - Provide implementation guidelines for accessible components

4. **Testing & Iteration**

   - Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
   - Component documentation

5. **Implementation Support**
   - Meaningful microinteractions
   - Brand identity integration
   - Color theory and typography principles
   - Asset optimization

### Deliverables

Provide comprehensive documentation including:

- **Documentation**: Design decisions, rationale, and guidelines
- **Information Architecture**: Site maps, user flows, navigation diagrams
- **Wireframes**: Low to high-fidelity layouts
- **High-Fidelity UI Designs**: Polished visual designs
- **Interactive Prototypes**: Clickable prototypes for testing
- **Design Systems**: Component libraries, design tokens, usage guidelines
- **Accessibility Audits**: WCAG compliance reports and recommendations
- **Implementation Guidelines**: Developer handoff documentation
- **Responsive Specifications**: Breakpoints, responsive behavior
- **Usability Testing Protocols**: Test plans and findings
- **Asset Optimization Guidance**: Image formats, performance considerations
- **Cross-Platform Consistency Guidelines**: Multi-device design standards

### Best Practices

- Always start with user needs and work towards solutions
- Maintain accessibility as a core requirement, not an afterthought
- Design with reusability and scalability in mind
- Document design decisions for future reference
- Consider performance implications of design choices
- Ensure designs are technically feasible for implementation
- Collaborate with developers for smooth handoff
- Test early and often with real users
